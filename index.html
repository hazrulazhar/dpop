      Tbe A.I. Museum of Art is a digital museum that exists to bring the implementation of artificial intelligence into art. By using the power of neural networks, we showcase how art can be generated with algorithms with the help of man. 
      We also showcase art from under-represented demographics in order to provide equitable outcomes especially for Asian and Female artists. In our maiden launch, we bring you 2 curations, one featuring exclusive female artists, and the other featuring exclusively Asian artists.
      You will learn more about these artists and their art, and will be able to generate art of your own using their canvasses as your filters and share it on Instagram. With these curations, we hope we get one step closer to equality and reduce discrimination in the world.
