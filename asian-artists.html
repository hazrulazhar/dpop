      <h2>Discrimination Faced</h2>
      <p>Asians as a whole have been discriminated violently in the west. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Asians living in the west
          had been a target of hate crime as they were being blamed for the virus. Crimes against Asians 150% within a year. The tensions 
          peaked in Atlanta, USA, on 16th March 2021 when 6 Asian women were killed senselessly sparking the #StopAsianHate movement. We hope
          through work produced by Asian artists, such discriminations will reduce. Click on an Asian artist to find out more about them and their work.
